This README provides an overview of our project's objectives, methodology, analysis, and key recommendations.

## Goal
Our project aims to analyze the impact of local crime rates on Airbnb listing prices in Chicago, utilizing advanced data transformation techniques and spatial data analysis to identify actionable insights.

## Data Sources
We harnessed public datasets including Airbnb listings and Chicago crime statistics to explore the intersection between crime rates and pricing strategies across different neighborhoods.

## EDA
Our exploratory data analysis involved:

1. Evaluating the distribution of Airbnb prices and understanding the influence of property types.
